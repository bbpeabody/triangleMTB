Creating Python virtual environment:
The AWS lambda function uses a python 3.6 environment, so create a python virtual environment using python 3.6.
All python packages will be installed in the virtual environment and packaged with the lamda function.

To create the virtual enviroment:
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.6 venv

To activate the virtual environment:
source venv/bin/activate

To deactivate:
deactivate

To install python packages:
First, activate the newly created virtual environment:
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install <package>
The packages will be installed in venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages.  These packages will be zipped up witht the
lambda function code by the "update" bash script.
